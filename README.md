# Highly Secured Authentication System Using Rest Apis And JWT.

I has developing a secured authentication and Authorization system using jwt . in this system i had generate two tokens first one is access token which has short period of time approximately 1 hour and another one is refresh token wich has 1 year of expiry date . basically what i do here , on the time of user signup or login i generate this to tokens and send back to client and then later on each request i send one additional header called authorization and in that header i pass this access token so then i can verify the token and extract the uid from it .
